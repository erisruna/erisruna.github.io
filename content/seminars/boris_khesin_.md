### Abstract
The binormal (or vortex filament) equation provides the localized induction approximation of the 3D incompressible Euler equation. We present a Hamiltonian framework for the binormal equation in higher-dimensions and its explicit solutions that collapse in finite time. In 2D we observe a curious appearance of the golden ratio in the motion of point vortices in the plane. This is a joint work with C.Yang and H.Wang.
