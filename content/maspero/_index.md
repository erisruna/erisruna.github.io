### Abstract:

Stokes waves are among the most famous global in time solutions
of the pure gravity water waves equations. They have the form of a
space-periodic profile traveling at constant speed, and were discovered
almost two centuries ago by Sir George Stokes.
A classical question in fluid mechanics is to study their stability vs
instability.
In the â€™60, Benjamin, Feir, Whitham, Lighthill and Zakharov discovered,
through experiments and formal arguments, that small amplitude periodic
Stokes waves in sufficiently deep water are unstable when subjected to
long-wave perturbations and proposed a heuristic mechanism that leads to
the disintegration of wave trains.
From a mathematical point of view this amount to study the spectral bands
that leave the imaginary axis of a Hamiltonian and reversible
pseudo-differential matrix valued operator with periodic coefficients.
In this course I will present recent mathematically rigorous results about
the band spectrum of the water waves equations linearized at the Stokes
solitary waves.
This material is based on joint works with M. Berti, P. Ventura and L.
Corsi.
