### Abstract:

This mini-course will serve as an introduction to the phase field models of
phase transitions and phase coexistence and will cover the following
subjects, time permitting:
- Introduction to models of phase transitions: van der Waals theory, Landau
theory, lattice gas, Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations;
- Spinodal decomposition and continuous ordering, nucleation and growth,
coarsening;
- Optimal bounds on coarsening rates.
