### By train + Bus: 

The closest train station is [Roma Tiburtina](https://www.stazioneromatiburtina.it/en/train-arrivals/). From the train station Roma Tiburtina there are three bus companies travelling to L'Aquila ([GASPARI](https://www.gasparionline.it/en/), [FLIXBUS](https://global.flixbus.com) or [TUA](https://www.tuabruzzo.it/)).
Please note that reaching L'Aquila from Rome by train is **not** recommended since it requires a much longer journey (it consists of a 3-hour, 1-connection trip, while the bus only takes one hour and 20 minutes). When reaching Rome by train, please select a train arriving at ROME TIBURTINA since there are no direct buses to L'Aquila from Roma Termini train station.
 Only TUA buses stop at Terminal Collemaggio station, from which you can reach GSSI in a few minutes on foot (but it does not travel on Sundays). The other companies stop at ex Hotel Amiternum and from there you can take a taxi for 10/15 euros to reach the centre of L'Aquila (from 7.30 am to 12 pm).
