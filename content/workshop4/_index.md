**Date: 19 May 2025 - 23 May 2025**

The workshop aims to bring together experts from various disciplines, including applied dynamical systems, optimization, and machine learning, to share the latest research advancements and address current challenges. By gathering specialists from different fields, the workshop seeks to create a friendly and welcoming environment that fosters innovative ideas, explores new research directions, and provides valuable opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange, ultimately advancing the field of numerics for dynamical systems, optimization and scientific machine learning.

The workshop will include invited presentations and contributed talks.

Invited talks:

  *   Lars Ruthotto (Emory University, USA)
  *   Karsten Urban (Ulm University, Germany)
  *   Beatrice Meini (University of Pisa, Italy)
  *   Matthew Colbrook (University of Cambridge, UK)
  *   Michele Buzzicotti (University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy)
  *   Francesco Regazzoni (Politecnico Milano, Italy)
  *   Olga Mula (TU/Eindhoven, The Netherlands)
  *   Des Higham (University of Edinburgh)
  *   Christian Lubich (University of Tuebingen, Germany)
  *   Benjamin Peherstorfer (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NY, USA)
  *   Marco Mondelli (Institute of Science and Technology, Austria)
  *   Holger Rauhut (TUM, Germany)
  *   Nicolas Gillis (University of Mons, Belgium)
  *   Ivan Markovsky (International Centre for Numerical Methods in Engineering, Barcelona, Spain)
  *   Jonas Latz (University of Manchester, UK)
  *   Konstantin Usevich (Nancy, France)


Contributed talks:

Prospective participants are welcome to submit an extended abstract using the following [indico page](https://indico.gssi.it/event/759), with up to 2 pages of technical content, including references. When submitting, please use the following [template](https://ftudisco.gitlab.io/data/template_abstract.tex). It is not necessary to entirely fill the two pages, especially if you have a paper published on the topic (in which case you can [provide the link to that paper](https://sites.google.com/view/lrma25/home/abstract-submission#h.2wl49uxqupkx))

Abstracts accepted by the scientific committee will be assigned to either an oral or poster presentation (you can indicate your preference when [submitting your paper](https://sites.google.com/view/lrma25/home/abstract-submission#h.l1olxqd8rb4n)).


Deadline for submission: 28 February 2025.


The workshop is organized as part of the intensive thematic semester on “hidden structures and pattern analysis” within the school of mathematics at GSSI.
