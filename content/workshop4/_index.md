The workshop aims to bring together experts from various disciplines, including applied dynamical systems, optimization, and machine learning, to share the latest research advancements and address current challenges. By gathering specialists from different fields, the workshop seeks to create a friendly and welcoming environment that fosters innovative ideas, explores new research directions, and provides valuable opportunities forcollaboration and knowledge exchange, ultimately advancing the field ofnumerics for dynamical systems, optimization and scientific machine learning.


The workshop is organised as part of an intensive thematic semester on “hidden structures and pattern analysis” within the school of mathematics at GSSI.
