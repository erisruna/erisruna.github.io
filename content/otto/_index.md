### Abstract
In this mini-course, we shall explain the variational approach to regularity theory for optimal transportation. As a text material, we refer to the lecture notes [arXiv:2303.14462](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14462). As opposed to the maximum-principle based regularity theory by Caffarelli for the Monge-Ampère equation, which has been extended to $\varepsilon$-regularity by Figalli et al, this approach follows a strategy analogous to minimal surfaces, in the sense that at its core is a harmonic approximation.
The advantage of this approach lies in its robustness, which allows to apply it to the optimal matching problem. For an introduction of the latter, see [recorded-lectures](https://www.mis.mpg.de/people/felix-otto/recorded-lectures) under “From combinatorics to partial differential equations”. This connects to work of Parisi et al and Ambrosio et al.
