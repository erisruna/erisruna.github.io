### Abstract: 

The goal of these lectures is to present a rigorous
mathematical analysis of the interaction of planar vortices in
two-dimensional viscous flows at high Reynolds numbers. To keep the
discussion as simple as possible, we focus on the particular case of a
pair of vortices with equal or opposite circulations, in the
well-prepared situation where these structures originate from point
vortices at initial time. In the large Reynolds number regime, we
construct an approximate solution of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations as
a power series in the (time-dependent) aspect ratio of the viscous
vortex pair. In particular, we compute the deformation of the stream
lines due to vortex interactions, and we determine the leading
order correction to the translation or rotation speed of the vortex
centers due to finite size effects. We then show that the exact
solution remains close to our approximation over a time interval that
increases boundlessly as the viscosity parameter goes to zero. The
proof relies on stability estimates derived from Arnold's variational
characterization of the steady states of the 2D Euler equation.
