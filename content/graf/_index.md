Topological insulators are materials that are conducting at their edge,
though not in the bulk. Their essential physical properties are encoded by
an index. After reviewing the historical origins, and the Quantum Hall
effect in particular, the appropriate indices will be discussed (Chern
numbers, index of a pair of projections), as well as bulk-edge
correspondence. Thereafter symmetry protected topological insulators will
be addressed. The focus will be on symmetries like time-reversal and
particle-hole conjugation and, correspondingly, on the Quantum Spin Hall
effect and Majorana zero modes in superconductors, in physical dimensions
d=2 and 1, respectively. More broadly, the Kitaev table describes the kind
of indices that occur in elation to many more symmetries, in any dimension
d, and its derivation will be treated. Special topics beyond the above
framework, such as time-dependent systems (Floquet or quantum pumps) or
classical systems (hydrodynamics) may occur too, as time permits.
