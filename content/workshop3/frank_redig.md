### Abstract
We consider mass transport models like KMP and the recently introduced continuous and discrete harmonic models. We prove intertwining with a "hidden parameter model". As a consequence, the boundary driven version of the model has a non-equilibrium steady state which is a mixture of product measures. For the harmonic model, we prove an additional spatial Markovian structure which enables to explicitly compute the invariant measure of the "hidden parameter model" for the geometry of a chain with left and right reservoirs. Based on joint work with Cristian Giardin√† and Berend van Tol.
