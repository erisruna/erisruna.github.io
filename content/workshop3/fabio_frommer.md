### Abstract
Interacting particle systems in a finite-volume are described by a grand-canonical ensemble induced by the corresponding Hamiltonian, i.e. a finite-volume Gibbs measure. However, in practice, directly measuring this Hamiltonian is not possible, as such, methods need to be developed to calculate the Hamiltonian potentials from measurable data. We give an expansion of the chemical potential and the pair potential in terms of the correlation functions of such a system that also holds in the thermodynamic limit. This is a justification of a formal approach of Nettleton and Green from the 50â€™s, that can be seen as an inverse cluster expansion.
