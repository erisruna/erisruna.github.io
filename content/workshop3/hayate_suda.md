### Abstract
The box-ball system (BBS) is a cellular automaton that exhibits the solitonic behavior. In recent years, with the rapid progress in the study of the hydrodynamics of integrable systems, there has been a growing interest in BBS with random initial distribution. In this talk, we consider the scaling limits for a tagged soliton in the BBS starting from certain stationary distribution. This talk is based on a joint work with Stefano Olla and Makiko Sasada.
