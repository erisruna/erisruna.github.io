### Abstract
We study phase transitions for a contact process on the d-dimensional lattice, where the agents that carry the infection move as an interchange process with density p,  where 0<p<1, evolving with rate v. We consider two limiting situations, as v tends to zero or to infinity. This is joint work (in preparation) with M. HilÃ¡rio (UFMG), D. Ungaretti (UFRJ) and D. Valesin (Warwick).
