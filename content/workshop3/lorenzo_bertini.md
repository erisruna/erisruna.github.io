### Abstract
We analyze the large time behavior of the rate function that describes the probability of large fluctuations of an underlying microscopic model associated to the homogeneous Boltzmann equation, such as the Kac walk. We consider in particular the asymptotic of the total number of collisions, per particle and per unit of time, and show it exhibits a phase transition in the joint limit in which the number of particles and the time interval diverge.
