The workshop aims to present the state of the art in understanding of the emergence of collective phenomena starting from particle systems, with a focus on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We provide a space for scientific exchanges among experts, PhD students and early-career researchers with common interests in the field of statistical mechanics.

The workshop will consist of invited talks and a session of selected contributed talks.
