### Abstract
Variational theories for cohesive fracture models hinge on free discontinuity energies having surface densities that are bounded and concave functions of the jump amplitude. Their phase-field approximation using Ambrosio and Tortorelli type functionals has been extensively studied both analytically and numerically in the last few years.
