### Abstract
joint work with Wentao Cao, and Dominik Inauen
For any given short embedding from an n-dimensional region into (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, and for any H ̈older exponent α < (n2 − n + 1)−1, a C1,α isometric embedding is built within any C0 neighbourhood of the given short embedding through convex integration, which refines the classical Nash-Kuiper the-
orem and extends the flexibility of C1,α isometric embedding beyond Borisov’s ex- ponent. Notably, when n = 2, we attain the Onsager exponent 13 for isometric embeddings. This convex integration scheme is performed through new construc-tion and leveraging iterative “integration by parts” to effectively transfer large-scale errors to smaller ones. In my talk, I would like to give some ideas for the “integration by parts” proce-dure. Furthermore, I will highlight the differences between the schemes that were previously used.
