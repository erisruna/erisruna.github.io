### Abstract
After reviewing the distributional approach recently developed to provide a well-posed formulation of the crystalline mean curvature flow, we show how to extend it to some nonlocal motions. Applications include the fractional mean curvature flow and the Minkowski flow; i.e., the geometric flow generated by the $(n-1)$-dimensional Minkowski pre-content.
