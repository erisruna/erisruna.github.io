The aim of this workshop is to bring together mathematicians working on nonlocal variational models and PDEs which arise both in theoretical and applied physical problems. A wide range of problems arising in interconnected mathematical fields will be considered, ranging from geometric analysis and regularity theory, fracture mechanics, free boundary problems and pattern formation to shape optimization.
