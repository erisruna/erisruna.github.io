### Abstract
In this seminar, I will present qualitative properties of a well-known free boundary problem modeling strong segregation among N competing populations in planar domains. The central result establishes that, generically, the domain partitions into subdomains characterized exclusively by triple junctions â€“ meaning that no more than three populations coexist at any point along the free boundary.
This is a joint work with F. Lanzara, E. Montefusco and V. Nesi (Sapienza).
