### Abstract
We will discuss the problem of the best approximation in the Wasserstein metric of the three-dimensional Lebesgue measure, by an atomic measure supported on a Bravais lattice. This is work in collaboration with David Bourne (Heriot-Watt University) and Steven Roper (University of Glasgow).
