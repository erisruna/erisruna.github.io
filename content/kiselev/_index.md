### Abstract:

I will discuss several recent themes in research on regularity and small
scale creation in equations
of fluid mechanics and related PDE. I will start with the broad overview
of the field, and then
present some recent results on small scale creation in solutions of the
incompressible porous media
equation and some other models. I will also talk about possible
suppression of singularity formation
by fluid flow. I will focus on the case of the Keller-Segel equation
that describes chemotaxis,
and is perhaps the most studied model of mathematical biology. The next
topic will be dynamics of
vortex and SQG patches. Patches are a special class of solutions for
which dynamics reduces
to evolution of a curve. I will talk about possible singularity
formation and recent ill-posedness results.
Finally, if time permits, I will discuss the method of modulus of
continuity for showing global regularity
of solutions to fluid mechanics PDE, and its recent application to an
equation proposed by Steinerberger
in connection with describing the evolution of polynomial roots under
differentiation.
