### Abstract
The zeroth laws of turbulence states that the energy dissipation rate remains positive in the infinite Reynolds number limit - this possibility is referred to as the phenomenon of anomalous dissipation, and is one of the central cornerstones of hydrodynamic turbulence. The analogous phenomenon for scalar fields advected in turbulent flows, known as the anomalous dissipation of scalar variance, is also well-known, with the basic model given by Kraichnan's seminal 1968 work. In this talk, based on recent joint work in Leipzig with Jan Burczak and Bian Wu, we show that weak solutions of the Euler equations, as conjectured by Onsager, lead to anomalous dissipation in the scalar advection-diffusion equation.
