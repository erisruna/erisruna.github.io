### Abstract
Entropy solutions of scalar conservation laws, even if merely bounded, share several structural properties with functions of bounded variation. As a first step in this direction for entropy solutions to 2x2 hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, we discuss a Liouville type theorem for isentropic solutions. The argument is based on a kinetic formulation of the system and some Lagrangian tools adapted from the scalar case. 
This is a joint work with F. Ancona and L. Talamini.
