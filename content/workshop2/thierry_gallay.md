### Abstract
We consider the unique axisymmetric solution without swirl of the 3D
Navier-Stokes equations with singular initial data corresponding to a
circular vortex filament. We are interested in the high Reynolds
number regime where the kinematic viscosity is small compared to the
circulation of the filament. We first construct an approximate
solution which can be expanded in powers of a small parameter
corresponding to the aspect ratio of the vortex ring. We then show
that the exact solution remains close to our approximation over a long
time interval, during which the vortex ring moves along its symmetry
axis at a speed that was predicted by Kelvin in 1867. To prove this,
we introduce self-similar variables located at the (unknown) position
of the ring, and we control the evolution of the perturbations using
an energy functional related to Arnold's variational characterization
of steady states for the 2D Euler equations. This talk is based on
joint work with Vladimir Sverak.
