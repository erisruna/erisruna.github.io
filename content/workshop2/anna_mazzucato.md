### Abstract
I will discuss recent results concerning the well-posedness and regularity for the incompressible Euler equations when in-flow and out-flow  boundary conditions are imposed on parts of the boundary, motivated by applications to boundary layers. This is joint work with Gung-Min Gie (U. Louisville, USA) and James Kelliher (UC Riverside, USA). I will also discuss energy dissipation and enstrophy production  in the zero-viscosity limit at outflow, joint work with (Jincheng Yang, U Chicago and IAS), Vincent Martinez (CUNY, Hunter College), and Alexis Vasseur (UT Austin).
