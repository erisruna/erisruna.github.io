### Abstract
After a broad introduction to large-time dynamics, the talk will focus on a part of the frontiers of our current understanding of nonlinear stability of traveling waves of partial differential equations, especially on how spectral stability implies nonlinear stability and which kind of dynamics may be expected. We shall highlight main expected difficulties related to the stability of discontinuous and/or characteristic waves of hyperbolic systems, and show a few significant steps obtained by the speaker with respectively Vincent Duchêne (Rennes), Gregory Faye (Toulouse) and Louis Garénaux (Karslruhe).
