### Abstract
If the initial vorticity of a two-dimensional incompressible flow is in $L^p$, then it is classically known that solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations converge to a solution of Euler in the zero viscosity limit. Here, the convergence of the corresponding vorticities is only weak. We will present some recent results on how to upgrade to strong convergence of vorticity. The problem is particularly interesting in a bounded domain.
