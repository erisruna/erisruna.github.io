The aim of this workshop is to bring together mathematicians working on different theoretical aspects of fluid mechanics. 

Recent progress on fundamental questions for fluid models stem at a crossroad among different mathematical fields, combining traditional approaches to PDEs with tools from geometric measure theory, dynamical systems, harmonic analysis or probability.

Topics that will be addressed include compressible and incompressible flows, hydrodynamic stability, mixing, instabilities and dissipation anomalies, non-uniqueness.
