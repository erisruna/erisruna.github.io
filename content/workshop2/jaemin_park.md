### Abstract
In this talk, we will discuss Leray-Hopf solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with vanishing viscosity. We explore important features of turbulence, focusing around the anomalous energy dissipation phenomenon. As a related result, I will present a recent result proving that for two-dimensional fluids, assuming that  the initial vorticity is merely a Radon measure with nonnegative singular part, there is no anomalous energy dissipation. Our proof draws on several key observations from the work of J. Delort (1991) on constructing global weak solutions to the Euler equation. This is a joint work with Luigi De Rosa (GSSI).
