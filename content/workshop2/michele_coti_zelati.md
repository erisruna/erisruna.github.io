### Abstract
The fast dynamo problem concerns the generation and maintenance of magnetic fields by fluid motion through the process of electromagnetic induction. In passive vector advection, this can be formulated as the exponential growth of the magnetic energy, at a resistivity-independent rate. In this talk, I will provide a construction of a Lipschitz, divergence-free and time-independent velocity field that is a fast dynamo on the whole space.
