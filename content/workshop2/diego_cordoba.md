### Abstract
We begin by reviewing recent constructions of finite 
time singularities in the 3D incompressible Euler equations and the 
hypodissipative Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we present a 
mechanism for blow-up in the 2D Boussinesq equation, achieved through 
a multi-layer degenerate pendula with a uniform $C^{1,\alpha}$ forcing 
term. These are joint works with Luis Martínez-Zoroa, Fan Zheng and Andrés Laín Sanclemente.
