### Abstract
We will give a survey of the use of Nash iterations (aka. convex integration) in the construction of “paradoxical” solutions to the incompressible Euler equations. Then, with refined methods, we will get a glimpse of how Nash iterations can be used to construct `turbulent' solutions. We will conclude with a discussion of potential limitations and future directions using these methods.
